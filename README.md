Mjolnir Standard Edition
========================

The following is a framework-like template to help you when using the Mjolnir
library. Please note that Mjolnir is a library not a framework, this is by no
way the only way you can structure your application.

See: [Install.md](Install.md) for installation instructions.

The Mjolnir Library uses a BSD 2-clause license.
